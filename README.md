# clypdown

## TL;DR  
I was trying to download a tune from [clyp](https://clyp.it/) and the download button was not enabled. No fear, the API comes to the rescue and we can ignore this.

## Demo  
Youtube vidya to come later or whatever, maybe once I add list mode.

```
$ python ~/clyp.py https://clyp.it/hrvttfzp
{i} Uploader has disabled downloading. Who fucking cares.
{*} Got song title: Sabrepulse feat. Ten Thousand Free Men & Their Families - Chiptune Night
{*} Got mp3 url: http://a.clyp.it/hrvttfzp.mp3
{*} Saving file to Sabrepulse feat. Ten Thousand Free Men & Their Families - Chiptune Night.mp3
